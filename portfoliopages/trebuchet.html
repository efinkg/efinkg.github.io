<p><span class = "aboutheading">Project Background:</span> The Elon student chapter of the Society of Physics Students uses a pumpkin-chunkin trebuchet for community outreach. We have been doing this community outreach since the fall of 2007. By inviting community members to bring their pumpkins the weekend after Halloween, and asking for a canned-food donation; the SPS provides fun and entertainment for the community, while collecting canned-food to distribute to needy members of the community.
</p>
    <p>
    I worked on the trebuchet for two years, with main collaboration from Jesse Clark.  Before this, the Society of Physics Students had built a much smaller trebuchet, but it had fallen into disrepair and there was no documentation on how to fix it. During the fall of 2010, we built the first incarnation of the current trebuchet, with some issues around structural integrity, and launch performance.<br>
In the fall of 2011, we hoped to improve structural integrity with a much larger diameter pivot bar, requiring some rebuild of the trebuchet such that the larger diameter pivot bar did not break through the launch arm or supporting uprights.  Finite element analysis was done at the end of fall 2011 to explore some ways of improving launch performance, and documentation was left for later years.

    At this point, I had designed a trebuchet that was close to useable, but required some strengthening in order to be useable long term.  The main issue we ran into was the bar the throwing arm was rotating about bent badly.  I wanted to increase from a 1" O.D. steel shaft to a 2 inch O.D. steel shaft, but wanted to be sure that we would not make the throwing arm (a 4x4 from the hardware store) excessively weak.
