<p>
At Elon University, for PHY398B, I worked with Dr. Scott Wolter of Duke University to help show that it was valid to use 100 micro electrodes to quickly and correctly monitor a redux couple reaction.  Traditional techniques require use of a single electrode, and can take several minutes to gather data.  In contrast, the instrument we were exploring the use of would collect the same data in ~2 seconds.  We hoped to show that the specific instrument we were using, <a href="http://www.scribner.com/fuel-cell-and-electrochemical-hardware/general-electrochemistry-products/150-multichannel-microelectrode-analyzer">the Scribner Associates MMA900</a> could be used to take these high speed measurements.
</p>
<p>
In order to show the validity of this instrument, we performed a series of experiments using the instrument for both tradional and Multichannel Multielectrode Analyzer measurements and verify we were getting similar results, and that the results we measured were similar to literature results for the standard redux couples we were measuring.
</p>
    
<p>  
In particular we hoped to show that we could sucessfully find the the formal potential. Redox couples are differentiated by their formal potentials, so by verifying we found literature values for the formal potential, we could verify performance of the system.
</p>
<p>
Some electrochemistry background.  With thanks to Dr. Karl Sienerth of Elon University.  We characterized this instrument with a standard reversible reduction/oxidation (redox) couple, ferro-/ferricyanide   
\(Fe(CN)^{4-/3-} _6\)
used in these trials produces a formal potential of the Fe(CN)64-/3- reaction: 
$$Fe(CN)_6 ^{4-} \leftrightarrow Fe(CN)_6 ^{3-} + e$$
</p>
<p>
The formal potential E0â€™ term may be seen in the Nernst Equation:   
$$E = E^{0'} - \frac{RT}{nF}ln\frac{C_0}{C_R} (1)$$
With E as the polarization voltage,F as the Faraday constant (96,485 C / mol), R is the universal gas constant (8.314 J/mol-K), T is the temperature (K), CO is the concentration of oxidized species in solution, and CR is the concentration of reduced species in solution.
