    <p>
		Creating a control system can be one of the most challenging elements 
of building a moving machine. This project develops a set of networkable
 control modules, each with a corresponding "virtual" software module. 
These building-blocks can then be combined to quickly prototype complex 
control systems.

		As a weekend project for MIT's "MAS.961: How to Make Something That 
Makes (Almost) Anything", I explored the low end of DIY 3D printing. 
This machine can be built at home in a day using a hot glue gun, an 
exacto knife, and less that $100 of materials and components. The use of
 foamcore as the primary structural component enables rapid iteration 
and easy experimentation.

Boston's Back Bay was measured using the body of then-fraternity-pledge 
Oliver Reed Smoot. In 2008 the MIT Class of 1962 commissioned me to 
design and fabricate a commemorative titanium plaque and concrete post -
 now mounted at the head of the bridge. I completed this assignment in 
collaboration with Ken Stone of the <a href="http://hobbyshop.mit.edu/">MIT Hobby Shop</a> and artist Melissa Rothstein.
