    		Jupiter Research Foundation desired to build an automated microscope payload to deploy in a standard Liquid Robotics Drybox. </p>
    	<p>
    		We chose to build our own microscope out of Navitar microscope components, building a exoskeleton frame to align all the parts to image through a simple rectangular glass flowcell.
    	</p>
    	
    	
    	    	<p><span class = "aboutheading">The Story: </span> In August 2009, MIT graduate student Maxim Lobovsky and I were sent to India by the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms to build a personal fabrication machine in the just erected Pune Fab Lab. We spent the first four days of our trip machining the aluminum structural tubes of the XY stage and Z axis using a ShopBot CNC wood router. Another day was consumed producing the plywood base, and yet another designing and laser-cutting the table. We also had the opportunity to work with students from the College of Engineering, Pune, (COEP) during the assembly process. After a week and a half the machine was producing networked stepper motor drivers capable of controlling the machine itself. This work was then presented at FAB5, the Fifth International Fab Lab Forum and Symposium on Digital Fabrication, which took place concurrently on the COEP campus. Since our trip, the machine design has been iterated upon four times. One of the descendants (shown above) was used by students in MIT's "MAS.863: How To Make (almost) Anything" to produce circuit boards for their weekly assignments.</p>
    	<p><span class = "aboutheading">Selected Design Features: </span>Two perpendicular shafts, each pulled by a set of belts and a high-resolution stepper motor, control the position of a toolhead located at their intersection. These shafts are supported by ball bearings which roll on inside surfaces of an aluminum tubular frame. A high-speed (20k RPM) spindle is implemented with $60 of entirely off-the-shelf components. Future plans involve adding an extrusion head and experimenting with combined extrusion and milling to increase accuracy and potentially reduce build times.</p>
