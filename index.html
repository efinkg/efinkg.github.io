            Welcome!
            <br> I am Ethan Glassman, I am currently a Masters of Engineering in Robotics student at Washington University in St. Louis.
            <br>
            <br> In my personal projects, my main focus is on designing mechanical systems, but I am curious as well about the electronics and software that tie those mechanical systems into real life. Many of these projects are described on this portolio page.
            <br>
            <br> In my professional work, in the summer of 2015 I will be working at GoogleX as a mechanical engineering intern. In the summer of 2014, I interned at Jupiter Research Foundation where I helped lead a project to build what we believe is the world’s only automated microscope, deployed in the Monterey Bay for 2 weeks after just four months development time. In the summer of 2013, I interned in R&D at Liquid Robotics, where I was part of a small team designing a major new sensor package for the company’s signature Wave Glider product. I was responsible for manufacturing several prototypes and designing the test beds and procedures to check their performance.
            <br>
            <br> My first exposure to mechanical engineering was FIRST robotics. As a FIRST alumnus, as well as CAD and mechanical mentor of two teams, I have experience of a tight schedule and rigorous testing of projects. In just six weeks, FIRST teams build a build a 120 pound robot to compete in the First Robotics Competition. More importantly though, FIRST robotics exposed me to how cool engineering could be.
